# math_stuff
just a few math related programs

other
  *BestMate (see inside .java)
  -Collatz to test the collatz conjecture, enter int, get path to 4 by %2==0 -> /2 and %2!=0 -> *3+1
  *DevNewton develops a full form of (a+b)^x where x is defined by the user. Lacks some functionality.
  -Emma is a tiny program made for a friend who wanted to see all permutations of 0-25 0-25 0-25
  *GoldBach tests the Goldbach conjecture on a number inputted by the user. Very crude algorithm.
  *Magic_squaresGen is supposed to generate magic squares, I haven't even started...
  -Randomizer is just a die of a number of faces chosen by the user. As random as Java can make it.
  *Sandpiles is... Weird. There's a link to youtube in the file and some bugs in the algorithm.
  -Water_Drips is the answer to that one question from a Google interview where it rains on a valley.
suites
  -Conway is not the game of life, but the suite where you explicit a line to get the next
  *Get10958 is an expression generator and evaluator, abandoned for a bigger calculator project. See youtube link.
  -Golden_ratio doesn't even calculate the golden ratio, it just prints the Fibonacci sequence
  -Pascal is kinda like Conway, only Pascal's triangle

*unfinished/could be better
